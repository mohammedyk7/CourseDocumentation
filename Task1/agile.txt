2--AGILE VS WATEWRFALL--
ADVANTAGES OF AGILE :
1- flexibilty : allows the team to respond to changes in requirements, client feedback & market trends quickly.
2-adaptability : ssures that the final product meets the customer's expectations & satisfies their needs.
3- continious delivery :continuous delivery of operating software solutions. This process confirms that the development team can provide high-quality software solutions to customers quickly.
DISADVATAGES OF AGILE :
1- Lack of Predictability :  The team can find it difficult to estimate how long a work would take, and the finished result might not meet the original specifications. Customers and stakeholders that anticipate a predictable timeframe for the software solution's delivery may become frustrated by the lack of predictability. 
2-Limited Scope:In terms of the software solution's scope, this method may be restrictive. Within the allotted period, the development team can find it difficult to provide a complete solution that satisfies every need of the client.
ADVANTAGES OF WATERFALL :
1-less coordination is needed because the stages and sequential operations are clearly defined.
2-A well-defined project phase aids in defining work dependencies.
3-Once the requirements are established, the project's cost can be estimated.
Increased emphasis on requirements and design documentation
enables big or evolving teams to collaborate toward a shared objective established during the requirements phase.
DISADVANTAGES OF WATERFALL:
1-Making adjustments is not supported by the waterfall model.
2-It can render your earlier work inadmissible.
3-Clients and end users are not included in this approach.
4-Testing is postponed until the project is finished.
5-Longer delivery times may be encouraged by the waterfall methodology.
agile is used in dynamic environment where waterfall is used in lower risks projects and doesn't require speed
