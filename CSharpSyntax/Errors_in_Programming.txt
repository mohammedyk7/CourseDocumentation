Errors in Programming//

As a beginner, it's crucial to understand errors in programming:

Syntax Errors: Incorrect syntax (missing semicolon).

Runtime Errors: Errors occurring during execution (divide by zero).

Logical Errors: Incorrect logic (wrong formula used).
try {
  int x = 10 / 0; // 
} catch (Exception e) {
  Console.WriteLine("Error: " + e.Message);
}
