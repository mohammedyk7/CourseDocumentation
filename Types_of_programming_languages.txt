ypes of Programming Languages

Understanding different types of programming languages helps beginners choose the right one:

Low-level (Machine/Assembly language): Direct hardware interaction.

High-level (C++, Java, Python): More abstract and human-readable.

Interpreted (Python, JavaScript) vs. Compiled (C, C++) languages.
