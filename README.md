1- analysis :
This phase's goal is to provide a more thorough definition of the system's inputs, outputs, processes, and interfaces. The system's procedures will be specified at the functional level at the end of this phase, which means that while the functions that need to be carried out will be known, the methods by which they will be carried out may not be.
inputs : collect the client requirements and demnads for the project 
outputs: backlog sheet created for the team filled with the tasks and iterations and timings .

2-design :
 During the first coding phase, developers use this phase as a guidance. The primary goal is to produce a comprehensive design that describes the system's functionality, user interfaces, and database structure.
inputs : user customization need for the web , colors and paints 
outputs :designed web template as a prototype which will be reviewed to the developer UI/UX

3-developer:
a web developers is the one who codes , for instance , the developer recieves the ui/ux template from the designer and code throught (the front end develper ) 
front end developer is also resposible for the front page the the customer or the user see .
back end : the developer behind the work used 

inputs : api designs by the backend developer 
outputs:api integrations linked to the client side rendering 

input of the front end : api codes recieved by the back-end 
output : integrate the api data 

4-testing :
As soon as programming is complete, testing begins. Any flaws in the program are repaired after a comprehensive evaluation. This stage guarantees that the program satisfies client needs.
inputs : reporting bugs and report the test for the results 
check the web perfomance if it passes or fails 
outputs : report the test results for the team to check for errors 
rearrange the prioroites of each error 

5-deployement:
is the crucial step in releasing developed software to its target audience. As the software enters a live environment, it marks the completion of development and testing activities.
inputs : check for security and develop the web 
outputs :verification and debug errors 

6-maintainance :
is the final part of the project that manages updates and fixes, guarantees ongoing software operation, and keeps the program current and working.
inputs : feedbacks from the user and apply changes in the project if needed 
cpu and memory usage 
outputs :
reslove the issues from the user 
update the softtware changes if needed

-- agile methadology of working and its purposes --
The Agile methodology is a project management technique that prioritizes adaptability and team work. Big businesses like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and others adopt this most recent approach. 
agile methodologies are well known for breaking a project up into manageable parts and adjusting to changing needs.
Their key concerns are client satisfaction, teamwork, and flexibility.
Large companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have embraced agile due to its adaptability and customer-focused approach.

2--AGILE VS WATEWRFALL--
ADVANTAGES OF AGILE :
1- flexibilty : allows the team to respond to changes in requirements, client feedback & market trends quickly.
2-adaptability : ssures that the final product meets the customer's expectations & satisfies their needs.
3- continious delivery :continuous delivery of operating software solutions. This process confirms that the development team can provide high-quality software solutions to customers quickly.

DISADVATAGES OF AGILE :
1- Lack of Predictability :  The team can find it difficult to estimate how long a work would take, and the finished result might not meet the original specifications. Customers and stakeholders that anticipate a predictable timeframe for the software solution's delivery may become frustrated by the lack of predictability. 
2-Limited Scope:In terms of the software solution's scope, this method may be restrictive. Within the allotted period, the development team can find it difficult to provide a complete solution that satisfies every need of the client.

ADVANTAGES OF WATERFALL :
1-less coordination is needed because the stages and sequential operations are clearly defined.
2-A well-defined project phase aids in defining work dependencies.
3-Once the requirements are established, the project's cost can be estimated.
Increased emphasis on requirements and design documentation
enables big or evolving teams to collaborate toward a shared objective established during the requirements phase.

DISADVANTAGES OF WATERFALL:
1-Making adjustments is not supported by the waterfall model.
2-It can render your earlier work inadmissible.
3-Clients and end users are not included in this approach.
4-Testing is postponed until the project is finished.
5-Longer delivery times may be encouraged by the waterfall methodology.
agile is used in dynamic environment where waterfall is used in lower risks projects and doesn't require speed
3-- state all framneworks --

agile :
kanban and scrum 

-- state all web applications in web development and services --
*cliend side rendering*
-blazor :
Ban open-source web framework that enables programmers to use C# and.NET to create interactive client-side web applications. To put it briefly, client-side Blazor  uses WebAssembly to bring C# to the browser.
Enables progressive web app development.
Create reusable C# components.
Server-side debugging is fully enabled.
Server-side rendering for faster WebSocket connections.
-angular:
used in JavaScript. But with the development of the technology, TypeScript has replaced JavaScript in Angular.
-next.js: Server-side rendering and static rendering are two more functionalities made possible by the React framework Next.js.
*server side rendering*:
MVC/BLAZOR:
represents the date applications  in the presentation tier 
(( *backend* ))(logic tier) : .net/.net core framework 

2- programming language c#
*data tier* // (database):
SQL server(c#) to ORM  (entity framework)

-- web stacks --
LARREL : MYSQL . PHP 
JAVA: ORACLE . JAVE SPRING 
.NET:DQLSERVEER C#.NET 
PYHTON : SQLHTE , PYHTON DIANGO

3-- TOOLS FOR DEPLOYEMENT --
DOCKER 
AZURE -- DEPOLYEMENT 
C# 
.NET 
DATABASAE SERVER -SQLSERVER

4-- scrum framework for agile : timings , meetings, roles --
timimgs : the agile largely depend in the timings for every iterations theres a limited timings 
meetings : standup meetings (daily) , sprint planning , sprint review and sprint retrospective 
roles  

-- explain in detail the git version control system explaining why and when we use it and all the related terms --
used to monitor file modifications for example merging and manage the efforts of several developers. It enables developers to effectively organize their source code, monitor modifications, work together, and roll back to earlier iterations when needed.branching -merging and most importantly handling conflicts .
*usage*:
1- branching // having a testing code for addition and trying new features so that the main code wont get affected 
2- merging // after positive and affective adddition to  the code , the main line will merge the feartures added  to the code or the project
3- handling conflicts 
*when to use it?*
- when handeling conflicts , a need to add new lines for tghe projects and pushing files to the hub by the cmd and for the team projects .


-- mention all the cloud repositories that uses git version control and compare between them --
1- github : open source projects 
2- git lab : self hosted 
3-azure devops:microsoft for enterprising 
4-google cloud: enterprises 
5-bitbucket : private repostories

-- state all the commands that you know with the explaining of each function of them --
git status (check if the user updated the file before adding)
git add . (adding the file to the system after updating )
git commit -m"" (for adding commit to the file )
git log --oneline (show the changes to the unstaged file)
git push (pushing the file to the repo)
git pull (pulling the file if the changed had been made in the repo ((adding commit))--for exmaple
git config user.name global
git config user.email global 
after installing the git so the cloud get known by the system and in the folders
